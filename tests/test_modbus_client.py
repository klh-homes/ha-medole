    Real-world trigger: the physical dehumidifier drops off the network,

    Before the P0 fix, _ensure_connection calls client.connect()
    synchronously on the event loop thread, freezing every other coroutine
    for that entire window.

    Test strategy: monkeypatch the underlying pymodbus client so connect()
    deterministically sleeps for BLOCK_SECONDS. In parallel, run a short
    asyncio.sleep and measure how long it ACTUALLY slept. If the event
    loop was frozen by connect(), the sleep overshoots badly.
